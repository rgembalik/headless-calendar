Headless Calendar is a simple, non-html abstract for creating calendar-oriented views.
Date-realated calculations are done with MomentJS and the entire thing is heavily inspired on HeadlessUI.

This particular package is a React component library. In this storybook you'll find:

- Date Picker - a simple date picker component implementation
- Calendar/Scheduler - a calendar view implementation for events (ToDo: add some actual events)

## Date Picker

## Calendar View
